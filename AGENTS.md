## Conventions

### Skills

Every skill lives in `plugins/hstack/skills/<skill-name>/` with a `SKILL.md` at the root. Frontmatter must include:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name            # Must match directory name
description: ...            # Used for discovery and triggering across all platforms
allowed-tools: "..."        # Codex tool scoping
---
```

Supporting files go in `references/`. Scripts go in `scripts/`. Keep `SKILL.md` body under 500 lines.

### Naming

- Directories: `kebab-case`
- Skill names: must match their parent directory name exactly
- References: `kebab-case.md`

### Adding a New Skill

1. `mkdir -p plugins/hstack/skills/<name>/references`
2. Create `plugins/hstack/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with required frontmatter
3. Create `rules/<name>.mdc` for Cursor auto-attachment (optional)
4. Update the skill table in `README.md`

### Agents

Agent definitions in `plugins/hstack/agents/` are markdown files that define personas or workflows. Use descriptive filenames.

### Commands

Slash commands in `plugins/hstack/commands/` are markdown files. The filename becomes the command name.

## Codex Compatibility

- Marketplace metadata lives in `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`
- The Codex plugin root is `plugins/hstack/`
- The Codex manifest must stay at `plugins/hstack/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- Test a checkout with `codex plugin marketplace add /path/to/hstack`
- Codex currently discovers skills from `plugins/hstack/skills/`; keep Claude/Cursor-only agents and commands out of the Codex manifest unless Codex adds manifest support for them

## Claude Compatibility

- Marketplace metadata lives in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- The Claude plugin root is `plugins/hstack/`
- The Claude manifest must stay at `plugins/hstack/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- Test a checkout with `claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/hstack --scope local` and `claude plugin install hstack --scope local`
- Claude auto-discovers `skills/`, `agents/`, and `commands/` from the plugin root

## Do Not

- Put anything other than the expected manifest JSON inside manifest directories
- Duplicate skill content across platforms — write once in `plugins/hstack/skills/`
- Add secrets, API keys, or `.env` files to this repo
