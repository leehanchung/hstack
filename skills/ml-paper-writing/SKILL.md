# ML Paper Writing for Top AI Conferences

Expert guidance for writing publication-ready papers targeting **NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, and COLM**. Combines writing philosophy from top researchers with practical workflows for citation verification, LaTeX formatting, and conference checklists.

## Core Philosophy

**Paper writing is collaborative, but Claude should be proactive in delivering drafts.**

When starting from a research repository:
1. **Understand the project** by exploring code, results, and existing docs
2. **Deliver a complete first draft** when confident about the contribution
3. **Search literature** using web search and APIs to find relevant citations
4. **Refine through feedback cycles** based on scientist input
5. **Ask for clarification** only when genuinely uncertain

**Key Principle**: Be proactive. If the repo and results are clear, deliver a full draft. Don't block waiting for feedback on every section.

---

## CRITICAL: Never Hallucinate Citations

**This is the most important rule in academic writing with AI assistance.**

AI-generated citations have a **~40% error rate**. Never generate BibTeX from memory.

| Action | Correct | Wrong |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Adding citation | Search API → verify → fetch BibTeX | Write BibTeX from memory |
| Uncertain about paper | Mark as `[CITATION NEEDED]` | Guess the reference |
| Can't find exact paper | Note: "placeholder - verify" | Invent similar-sounding paper |

**When you cannot verify a citation:**
```latex
\cite{PLACEHOLDER_author2024_verify}  % TODO: Verify this citation exists
```

Always tell the scientist: "I've marked [X] citations as placeholders that need verification."

**For paper search, use:**
- Exa MCP (if available): `claude mcp add exa -- npx -y mcp-remote "https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp"`
- Web search for paper titles/authors
- Verify with Semantic Scholar API, then fetch BibTeX via DOI

See [references/citation-workflow.md](references/citation-workflow.md) for complete API documentation.

## The Narrative Principle

**Your paper is not a collection of experiments—it's a story with one clear contribution.**

Every successful ML paper centers on what Neel Nanda calls "the narrative": a short, rigorous, evidence-based technical story with a takeaway readers care about.

**Three Pillars (must be crystal clear by end of introduction):**

| Pillar | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **The What** | 1-3 specific novel claims | "We prove that X achieves Y under condition Z" |
| **The Why** | Rigorous empirical evidence | Strong baselines, distinguishing experiments |
| **The So What** | Why readers should care | Connection to recognized community problems |

**If you cannot state your contribution in one sentence, you don't yet have a paper.**

## Workflow 1: Starting from a Research Repository

```
Project Understanding:
- [ ] Step 1: Explore the repository structure
- [ ] Step 2: Read README, existing docs, and key results
- [ ] Step 3: Identify the main contribution with the scientist
- [ ] Step 4: Find papers already cited in the codebase
- [ ] Step 5: Search for additional relevant literature
- [ ] Step 6: Draft sections iteratively with feedback
```

**Step 1: Explore the Repository**
```bash
ls -la
find . -name "*.py" | head -20
find . -name "*.md" -o -name "*.txt" | xargs grep -l -i "result\|conclusion"
```

Look for: `README.md`, `results/`, `outputs/`, `experiments/`, existing `.bib` files.

**Step 2: Identify Existing Citations**
```bash
grep -r "arxiv\|doi\|cite" --include="*.md" --include="*.bib" --include="*.py"
```

**Step 3: Clarify the Contribution**

Before writing, confirm with the scientist:
> "Based on my understanding of the repo, the main contribution appears to be [X]. Is this the framing you want, or should we emphasize different aspects?"

**Step 4: Deliver a First Draft**

If the repo provides clear results and the contribution is apparent:
1. Write the full first draft end-to-end
2. Present the complete draft for feedback
3. Iterate based on scientist's response

---

## Workflow 2: Writing a Complete Paper

```
Paper Writing Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Define the one-sentence contribution
- [ ] Step 2: Draft Figure 1
- [ ] Step 3: Draft abstract (5-sentence formula)
- [ ] Step 4: Draft introduction (1-1.5 pages max)
- [ ] Step 5: Draft methods
- [ ] Step 6: Draft experiments
- [ ] Step 7: Draft related work
- [ ] Step 8: Draft limitations (required)
- [ ] Step 9: Complete paper checklist
- [ ] Step 10: Final review and submission
```

### Abstract: 5-Sentence Formula (Sebastian Farquhar)

```
1. What you achieved: "We introduce...", "We prove..."
2. Why this is hard and important
3. How you do it (with specialist keywords)
4. What evidence you have
5. Your most remarkable number/result
```

**Delete** generic openings like "Large language models have achieved remarkable success..."

### Introduction Structure (1-1.5 pages max)

- 2-4 bullet contribution list (max 1-2 lines each)
- Clear problem statement
- Brief approach overview
- Methods should start by page 2-3

### Experiments Section

For each experiment, explicitly state:
- What claim it supports
- How it connects to main contribution
- What to observe: "the blue line shows X, demonstrating Y"

Requirements:
- Error bars with methodology (std dev vs std error)
- Hyperparameter search ranges
- Compute infrastructure (GPU type, total hours)

### Limitations Section (REQUIRED)

All major conferences require this. Counter-intuitively, honesty helps:
- Reviewers are instructed not to penalize honest limitation acknowledgment
- Pre-empt criticisms by identifying weaknesses first

---

## Workflow 3: Citation Verification

```
Citation Verification (MANDATORY for every citation):
- [ ] Step 1: Search using web search or Semantic Scholar API
- [ ] Step 2: Verify paper exists in 2+ sources
- [ ] Step 3: Retrieve BibTeX via DOI (programmatically)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify the claim you're citing actually appears in the paper
- [ ] Step 5: Add verified BibTeX to bibliography
- [ ] Step 6: If ANY step fails → mark as placeholder
```

**Python: Get BibTeX from DOI**
```python
import requests

def doi_to_bibtex(doi: str) -> str:
    response = requests.get(
        f"https://doi.org/{doi}",
        headers={"Accept": "application/x-bibtex"}
    )
    return response.text

bibtex = doi_to_bibtex("10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762")
```

See [references/citation-workflow.md](references/citation-workflow.md) for complete implementation.

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Sentence-Level Clarity (Gopen & Swan's 7 Principles)

| Principle | Rule | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Subject-verb proximity** | Keep subject and verb close | "The model achieves..." not "The model, which was trained on..., achieves" |
| **Stress position** | Place emphasis at sentence ends | "When using attention, accuracy improves by **15%**" |
| **Topic position** | Put context first | "Given these constraints, we propose..." |
| **Old before new** | Familiar info → unfamiliar info | Link backward, then introduce new |
| **Action in verb** | Use verbs, not nominalizations | "We analyzed" not "We performed an analysis" |

### Word Choice (Zachary Lipton)

- **Be specific**: "accuracy" or "latency" not "performance"
- **Eliminate hedging**: Drop "may" and "can" unless genuinely uncertain
- **Avoid incremental vocabulary**: "develop" not "combine" or "modify"
- **Delete intensifiers**: "tight approximation" not "very tight approximation"

### Micro-Level Tips (Ethan Perez)

- **Minimize pronouns**: "This result shows..." not "This shows..."
- **Verbs early**: Position verbs near sentence start
- **Delete filler words**: "actually," "basically," "essentially," "quite"

See [references/writing-guide.md](references/writing-guide.md) for complete writing philosophy.

## LaTeX Templates

When starting a new paper, copy the entire template directory:
```bash
cp -r templates/neurips2025/ ~/papers/my-new-paper/
cd ~/papers/my-new-paper/
```

**Verify template compiles before changes:**
```bash
latexmk -pdf main.tex
```

| Conference | Main File | Style File |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| NeurIPS 2025 | `main.tex` | `neurips.sty` |
| ICML 2026 | `example_paper.tex` | `icml2026.sty` |
| ICLR 2026 | `iclr2026_conference.tex` | `iclr2026_conference.sty` |
| ACL | `acl_latex.tex` | `acl.sty` |
| AAAI 2026 | `aaai2026-unified-template.tex` | `aaai2026.sty` |
| COLM 2025 | `colm2025_conference.tex` | `colm2025_conference.sty` |

---

## Tables and Figures

### Tables (use booktabs)
```latex
\usepackage{booktabs}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
Method & Accuracy ↑ & Latency ↓ \\
\midrule
Baseline & 85.2 & 45ms \\
\textbf{Ours} & \textbf{92.1} & 38ms \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
```

### Figures
- **Vector graphics** (PDF, EPS) for all plots
- **Colorblind-safe palettes**: Okabe-Ito or Paul Tol
- **Self-contained captions**: Reader should understand without main text
- **No title inside figure**: Caption serves this function

---

## Common Issues

**Abstract too generic**: Delete first sentence if it could be prepended to any ML paper.

**Introduction too long**: Split background into Related Work. Methods should start by page 2-3.

**Experiments lack claims**: Add "This experiment tests whether [specific claim]..."

**Missing statistics**: Always include error bars, number of runs, statistical tests.

---

## Time Allocation (Neel Nanda)

Spend approximately **equal time** on each of:
1. The abstract
2. The introduction
3. The figures
4. Everything else combined

Most reviewers form judgments before reaching your methods section.

---

## Reviewer Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | What Reviewers Look For |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Quality** | Technical soundness, well-supported claims |
| **Clarity** | Clear writing, reproducible by experts |
| **Significance** | Community impact, advances understanding |
| **Originality** | New insights (doesn't require new method) |

See [references/reviewer-guidelines.md](references/reviewer-guidelines.md) for detailed evaluation criteria.
